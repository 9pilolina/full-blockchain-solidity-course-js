- **Stunning visuals:** The 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray offers a significant improvement over the previous Blu-ray releases, with enhanced clarity, detail, color, and contrast. The film was shot on 35mm film, which gives it a natural grain and texture that is preserved in the 4K transfer. The HDR10 and Dolby Vision options also add more depth and realism to the image, especially in the dark scenes and the vibrant colors of Skull Island. The CGI effects of Kong and the other creatures still hold up remarkably well, and look even more impressive in 4K.
- **Immersive audio:** The 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray features a Dolby Atmos soundtrack that delivers a powerful and immersive sound experience. The film has a rich and dynamic score by James Newton Howard, as well as a plethora of sound effects that create a realistic and atmospheric soundscape. The dialogue is clear and balanced, and the surround channels are used effectively to create a sense of directionality and movement. The subwoofer also adds a lot of impact and rumble to the action scenes, especially when Kong roars or fights.
- **Comprehensive extras:** The 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray comes with three discs: one for the theatrical cut, one for the extended edition, and one for the bonus materials. The theatrical cut runs for 187 minutes, while the extended edition adds 13 minutes of additional footage that expands on some character moments and action scenes. Both versions are worth watching, as they offer different perspectives on the story and the characters. The bonus disc contains over seven hours of documentaries, featurettes, deleted scenes, commentaries, and more that cover every aspect of the production, from pre-production to post-production. Some of the highlights include Peter Jackson's production diaries, which offer a candid and fascinating look at the daily challenges and achievements of making such an ambitious film; the post-production diaries, which show how the film was edited, scored, mixed, and finalized; and the making-of documentary "The Eighth Wonder of the World", which is a comprehensive and informative overview of the entire project.

In conclusion, King Kong: The Ultimate Edition is a must-have for fans of the film and for anyone who appreciates epic filmmaking. It is a stunning presentation of a classic story that showcases Peter Jackson's vision and passion for cinema. It is also a tribute to the original King Kong from 1933, which inspired Jackson and many other filmmakers to pursue their dreams. If you are looking for a way to experience King Kong in its full glory, look no further than this 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release.
