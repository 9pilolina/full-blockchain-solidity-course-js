# How to Use SplineLand for 3ds Max to Create Realistic Terrains
 
SplineLand is a plugin for Autodesk 3ds Max that helps to generate topographically accurate terrains from a set of splines and lay roads. Without SplineLand it is almost impossible to achieve such accurate results in 3ds Max[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. In this article, we will show you how to use SplineLand to create realistic terrains in a few simple steps.

## Step 1: Install SplineLand
 
To install SplineLand, you need to download the plugin from the official website[^3^] or from other sources[^1^] [^2^]. Make sure you choose the right version for your 3ds Max. After downloading, copy the SplineLand.dlm file to the plugins folder of your 3ds Max installation directory. For example, C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2020\plugins. Then restart 3ds Max and you should see SplineLand in the Create panel under Geometry.
 
## Step 2: Create Splines
 
To create a terrain with SplineLand, you need to have some splines that represent the topographic contours or shapes of your terrain. You can use any types of splines, including open splines[^1^] [^3^]. You can create splines manually in 3ds Max or import them from other sources, such as CAD files or GIS data. Make sure the splines are in one plane each and have different Z values according to their elevation. You can also assign different ID values to different splines to control the level of detail and grid density of your terrain[^1^] [^3^].
 
## Step 3: Generate Terrain
 
Once you have your splines ready, you can generate the terrain with SplineLand. To do this, go to the Create panel and select SplineLand from Geometry. Then click anywhere in the viewport to create a SplineLand object. In the Modify panel, you will see several parameters and options for your terrain. The most important ones are:
 
- Splines: Here you can add or remove the splines that will be used to generate the terrain. You can also adjust their Z offset and ID values.
- Grid: Here you can control the grid density and size of your terrain. You can also enable adaptive grid option to automatically adjust the grid density according to the spline ID values.
- Surface: Here you can control the surface smoothing and subdivision of your terrain. You can also enable UVW mapping option to apply textures to your terrain.
- Roads: Here you can add or remove roads that will be laid over the terrain. You can also adjust their width, height, slope and banking.
- Areas: Here you can add or remove areas that will be leveled or cut on the terrain. You can also adjust their height, angle and shape.

After adjusting these parameters and options, you can click on Generate button to create your terrain. You can also use Update button to update your terrain if you make any changes to the splines or other settings.
 
## Step 4: Render and Enjoy
 
Now you have a realistic terrain created with SplineLand. You can apply materials, lights and cameras to your scene and render it with your preferred renderer. You can also export your terrain as a mesh or a height map for other purposes. Enjoy your creation!
